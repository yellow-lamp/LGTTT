# CS101: Problem Solving and Programming I

## About

An entry-level course and a major requirement for CS/IT students, CS101 teaches the basic concepts of programming in an object-oriented approach.
This course was previously taught in C++, but is now taught in Python 3.

> Note: there is now an accompanying (required) lab, CS101L, to practise these concepts on a weekly basis.
