# Let's Get Through This Together

I'm beginning this project as to stave off the potential complacency onset in the absence of continual learning. If you would like to look beyond this project, see [other resources](resources/etc/other-resources.md).

## Let's Get Started

For a shortlist of where everything can be found, see the [main directory](directory.md) page.

## Contributing

The platform is open for anyone to edit and expand after verification.

### Verification

You may ask for contributor permissions at either the UMKC Computer Science's [Slack](), or [Discord](https://discord.gg/kswjW6n) (our main line of communication). Mention one of the staff to add you to the project.
